# aggregate_block_list

The powershell file adblock_total.ps1 when run should:
pulls from a txt file a list of supposedly reputable domain name block lists maintained by other people, 
aggregates it all together into 1 master list, 
standardizes the format to the adblock-plus format, 
and then sorts and dumps the file.

the final_list file is manually edited to add/remove whatever I want.

Use it however you like. I don't care.
