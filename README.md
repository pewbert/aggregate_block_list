# aggregate_block_list

Powershell scripts to aggregate domain names for adblocking into 1 file.
adblock_total.ps1 is for adblock plus
adblock_host_filter.ps1 is for a generic /etc/host file and more universal, probably. Works with Open-WRT adblock-fast mod Version 1.1.1-5
sorted is ascending order and no duplicates. Greatly reduces file size.


Use it however you like. I don't care.
